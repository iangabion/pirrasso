            <h3>Terms And Conditions</h3>
            <br>
            <p>These terms and conditions (“Agreement”) set forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the “Bon Plan” mobile application 
                (“Mobile Application” or “Service”) and any of its related products and services (collectively, “Services”). This Agreement is legally 
                binding between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and this Mobile Application developer (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering 
                into this agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this agreement, 
                in which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of 
                this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not access and use the Mobile Application and Services. By accessing and using the Mobile 
                Application and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. You acknowledge that this 
                Agreement is a contract between you and the Operator, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you, and it governs your use of the 
                Mobile Application and Services.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Accounts And Membership</h4>
            <br>
            <p>You must be at least 16 years of age to use the Mobile Application and Services. By using the Mobile Application and Services and by agreeing 
                to this Agreement you warrant and represent that you are at least 16 years of age.</p><br>
            <p>If you create an account in the Mobile Application, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and you are fully responsible 
                for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with it. We may monitor and review new accounts before you 
                may sign in and start using the Services. Providing false contact information of any kind may result in the termination of your account. You must 
                immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, 
                including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) 
                if we determine that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. 
                If we delete your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for our Services. We may block your email address and Internet protocol 
                address to prevent further registration.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>User content</h4>
            <br>
            <p>We do not own any data, information or material (collectively, “Content”) that you submit in the Mobile Application in the course of using the Service. 
                You shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and intellectual property ownership 
                or right to use of all submitted Content. We may monitor and review the Content in the Mobile Application submitted or created using our Services by you. 
                You grant us permission to access, copy, distribute, store, transmit, reformat, display and perform the Content of your user account solely as required 
                for the purpose of providing the Services to you. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, we have the right, though not the obligation, 
                to, in our own sole discretion, refuse or remove any Content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any of our policies or is in any way harmful or 
                objectionable. You also grant us the license to use, reproduce, adapt, modify, publish or distribute the Content created by you or stored in your user 
                account for commercial, marketing or any similar purpose. </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Adult Content</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Please be aware that there may be certain adult or mature content available in the Mobile Application. Where there is mature or adult content, individuals 
                who are less than 18 years of age or are not permitted to access such content under the laws of any applicable jurisdiction may not access such content. If 
                we learn that anyone under the age of 18 seeks to conduct a transaction through the Services, we will require verified parental consent, in accordance with 
                the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”). Certain areas of the Mobile Application and Services may not be available to children under 
                18 under any circumstances.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Backups</h4>
            <br>
            <p>We perform regular backups of the Content and will do our best to ensure completeness and accuracy of these backups. In the event of the hardware failure or 
                data loss we will restore backups automatically to minimize the impact and downtime. </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Links to other resources</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Although the Mobile Application and Services may link to other resources (such as websites, mobile applications, etc.), we are not, directly or indirectly, 
                implying any approval, association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with any linked resource, unless specifically stated herein. Some of the links 
                in the Mobile Application may be “affiliate links”. This means if you click on the link and purchase an item, the Operator will receive an affiliate 
                commission. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any businesses or individuals or the content of their 
                resources. We do not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, products, services, and content of any other third parties. You should carefully 
                review the legal statements and other conditions of use of any resource which you access through a link in the Mobile Application. Your linking to any other 
                off-site resources is at your own risk.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Prohibited Uses</h4>
            <br>
            <p>In addition to other terms as set forth in the Agreement, you are prohibited from using the Mobile Application and Services or Content: (a) for any unlawful 
                purpose; (b) to solicit others to perform or participate in any unlawful acts; (c) to violate any international, federal, provincial or state regulations,

                will or may be used in any way that will affect the functionality or operation of the Mobile Application and Services, third party products and services, 
                or the Internet; (h) to spam, phish, pharm, pretext, spider, crawl, or scrape; (i) for any obscene or immoral purpose; or (j) to interfere with or circumvent
                 the security features of the Mobile Application and Services, third party products and services, or the Internet. We reserve the right to terminate your use

            <h4>Limitation of liability</h4>
            <br>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will the Operator, its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, suppliers or 
                licensors be liable to any person for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive, cover or consequential damages (including, without limitation, damages 
                for lost profits, revenue, sales, goodwill, use of content, impact on business, business interruption, loss of anticipated savings, loss of business 
                opportunity) however caused, under any theory of liability, including, without limitation, contract, tort, warranty, breach of statutory duty, negligence 
                or otherwise, even if the liable party has been advised as to the possibility of such damages or could have foreseen such damages. To the maximum extent 
                permitted by applicable law, the aggregate liability of the Operator and its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers and licensors relating to 
                the services will be limited to an amount no greater than one dollar or any amounts actually paid in cash by you to the Operator for the prior one month 
                period prior to the first event or occurrence giving rise to such liability. The limitations and exclusions also apply if this remedy does not fully 
                compensate you for any losses or fails of its essential purpose.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Indemnification</h4>
            <br>
            <p>You agree to indemnify and hold the Operator and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, suppliers and licensors harmless from and against 
                any liabilities, losses, damages or costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred in connection with or arising from any third party allegations, 
                claims, actions, disputes, or demands asserted against any of them as a result of or relating to your Content, your use of the Mobile Application and 
                Services or any willful misconduct on your part.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Dispute resolution</h4>
            <br>
            <p>The formation, interpretation, and performance of this Agreement and any disputes arising out of it shall be governed by the substantive and procedural 
                laws of France without regard to its rules on conflicts or choice of law and, to the extent applicable, the laws of France. The exclusive jurisdiction and 
                venue for actions related to the subject matter hereof shall be the courts located in France, and you hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of such 
                courts. You hereby waive any right to a jury trial in any proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement. The United Nations Convention on Contracts 
                for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.</p>
